(2) V has only set many grounds if and only if the mantle is a ground. We also show that if the universe has some very large cardinal, then the mantle must be a ground. }

Ann., 112, 727–742). We show that this class of functions can also be characterized by MS-machines, which are Turing machine-like devices. The proof of the characterization gives a normal form theorem in the style of Kleene (1936, Math. Ann., 112, 727–742). Furthermore, this characterization is a natural combination of two most influential theories of computation over real numbers, namely the type-two theory of effectivity (see, e.g. Weihrauch (2000, Springer)) and the Blum–Shub–Smale (1989, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.), 21, 1–46) model of computation. Under this notion of computability, the recursive (or computable) subsets of real numbers are exactly effective \$\\varDelta ^0\_2\$ sets.},
